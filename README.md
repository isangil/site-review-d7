Site-Review-D7
==============

Packages a Drupal 7 based profile to create a Website dedicated for NSF LTER Site Reviews 

Every 5 years, a NSF appointed panel visits an LTER site to audit the work done with the
grant funding provided. The panelists usually visit the site, and revise the work. A
flexible agenda is built for the process, with events that happen at a given date time and
place. Participants are listed in a directory with contact information, and a sleught of 
documents are ordered to facilitate the review, including, research summaries, accomplishments
bibliographical citations.  Many documents are enriched with media, such as photos or videos.

Here, you will download a Drupal seven based profile that will facilitate the dissemination
of all the information above. Just drop it in a web enabled folder on a server, or in a host
provider, and install following the usual Drupal profile installation steps.

This site can be adapted for small meetings too.
